<h2>Subject-Verb Agreement</h2>
<p><br>
Subject-Verb Agreement<br>
<br>
Subject-verb agreement is an important part of English grammar. It is important to understand and use subject-verb agreement correctly in order to communicate effectively in English.<br>
<br>
In English, the subject and verb must agree in number. This means that the verb must be singular if the subject is singular, and the verb must be plural if the subject is plural.<br>
<br>
For example:<br>
<br>
Singular subject: The dog barks.<br>
Plural subject: The dogs bark.<br>
<br>
In English, the verb must also agree with the subject in person. This means that the verb must be in the first person if the subject is in the first person, and the verb must be in the third person if the subject is in the third person.<br>
<br>
For example:<br>
<br>
First person subject: I walk.<br>
Third person subject: He walks.<br>
<br>
In English, the verb must also agree with the subject in tense. This means that the verb must be in the present tense if the subject is in the present tense, and the verb must be in the past tense if the subject is in the past tense.<br>
<br>
For example:<br>
<br>
Present tense subject: She reads.<br>
Past tense subject: She read.<br>
<br>
It is important to remember that subject-verb agreement is not always straightforward. There are some special cases that require careful consideration.<br>
<br>
For example:<br>
<br>
Compound subjects: When the subject is composed of two or more nouns or pronouns connected by “and”, the verb should be plural.<br>
<br>
For example:<br>
<br>
The dog and the cat bark.<br>
<br>
Indefinite pronouns: When the subject is an indefinite pronoun, the verb should be singular.<br>
<br>
For example:<br>
<br>
Nobody walks.<br>
<br>
Collective nouns: When the subject is a collective noun, the verb should be singular.<br>
<br>
For example:<br>
<br>
The team plays.<br>
<br>
In conclusion, subject-verb agreement is an important part of English grammar. It is important to understand and use subject-verb agreement correctly in order to communicate effectively in English.</p>
<h2>Tenses</h2>
<p><br>
Tenses<br>
<br>
In English, there are three main tenses: present, past, and future. Each of these tenses has four forms: simple, continuous, perfect, and perfect continuous.<br>

<h2>Modal Verbs</h2>
<p><br>
Modal Verbs<br>
<br>
Modal verbs are auxiliary verbs that express possibility, ability, permission, or obligation. They are used to modify the meaning of other verbs. The most common modal verbs are can, could, may, might, must, shall, should, will, and would.<br>
<br>
Examples:<br>
<br>
Can: I can speak English.<br>
<br>
Could: I could speak English when I was a child.<br>
<br>
May: You may leave now.<br>
<br>
Might: She might be late.<br>
<br>

<br>
Shall: Shall we go now?<br>
<br>
Should: You should study more.<br>
<br>
Will: I will help you.<br>
<br>
Would: Would you like to go out?<br>
<br>
Modal verbs are followed by the base form of the verb.<br>
<br>
Examples:<br>
<br>
Can: I can speak English.<br>
<br>
Could: I could speak English when I was a child.<br>
<br>
May: You may leave now.<br>
<br>
Might: She might be late.<br>
<br>

<br>
• Habitual actions: I could speak English when I was a child.<br>
<br>
It is important to note that modal verbs are not used in the past tense.<br>
<br>
Examples:<br>
<br>
Incorrect: I could spoke English when I was a child.<br>
<br>
Correct: I could speak English when I was a child.</p>
<h2>Adjectives and Adverbs</h2>
<p><br>
Adjectives and Adverbs<br>
<br>
Adjectives and adverbs are two of the most important parts of speech in English. Adjectives are words that describe nouns or pronouns, while adverbs are words that modify verbs, adjectives, and other adverbs.<br>
<br>
Adjectives<br>
<br>
Adjectives are words that describe nouns or pronouns. They can be used to describe the size, shape, color, or other qualities of a noun or pronoun. For example, in the sentence "The big, red balloon floated away," the words "big" and "red" are adjectives.<br>
<br>
Adjectives can also be used to compare two or more nouns or pronouns. For example, in the sentence "The elephant is bigger than the mouse," the word "bigger" is an adjective.<br>
<br>
Adverbs<br>
<br>
Adverbs are words that modify verbs, adjectives, and other adverbs. They can be used to describe how, when, or where an action is performed. For example, in the sentence "He quickly ran away," the word "quickly" is an adverb.<br>
<br>
Adverbs can also be used to compare two or more verbs, adjectives, or adverbs. For example, in the sentence "He ran faster than his brother," the word "faster" is an adverb.<br>
<br>
Practice<br>
<br>
Now that you understand the difference between adjectives and adverbs, try using them in your own sentences. Think of a noun or pronoun and describe it using an adjective. Then, think of a verb and modify it using an adverb.</p>
<h2>Prepositions</h2>
<p><br>
Prepositions<br>
<br>
Prepositions are words that show the relationship between a noun or pronoun and other words in a sentence. Prepositions are usually placed before a noun or pronoun and they tell you where or when something is happening.<br>
<br>
Common Prepositions:<br>
<br>
- Above<br>
- Across<br>
- After<br>
- Against<br>
- Along<br>
- Among<br>
- Around<br>
- At<br>
- Before<br>
- Behind<br>
- Below<br>
- Beneath<br>
- Beside<br>
- Between<br>
- Beyond<br>
- By<br>
- Down<br>
- During<br>
- Except<br>
- For<br>
- From<br>
- In<br>
- Inside<br>
- Into<br>
- Near<br>
- Of<br>
- Off<br>
- On<br>
- Onto<br>
- Out<br>
- Outside<br>
- Over<br>
- Past<br>
- Through<br>
- To<br>
- Toward<br>
- Under<br>
- Until<br>
- Up<br>
- Upon<br>
- With<br>
- Within<br>
- Without<br>
<br>
Uses of Prepositions:<br>
<br>
1. To show location:<br>
<br>
Examples:<br>
<br>
- The cat is under the table.<br>
- The book is on the shelf.<br>
<br>
2. To show direction:<br>
<br>
Examples:<br>
<br>
- She walked to the store.<br>
- He drove from his house.<br>
<br>
3. To show time:<br>
<br>
Examples:<br>
<br>
- We will meet at noon.<br>
- She arrived before dinner.<br>
<br>
4. To show possession:<br>
<br>
Examples:<br>
<br>
- The dog is my brother's.<br>
- The house is theirs.<br>
<br>
5. To show a relationship between two nouns:<br>
<br>
Examples:<br>
<br>
- The book is about history.<br>
- She is the teacher of the class.</p>
<h2>Relative Clauses</h2>
<p><br>
Relative Clauses<br>
<br>
Relative clauses are an important part of English grammar, and they are often tested on the TOEFL exam. A relative clause is a type of subordinate clause that modifies a noun or pronoun. It is usually introduced by a relative pronoun such as “who,” “which,” “that,” or “whose.”<br>
<br>
For example:<br>
<br>
The man who lives next door is a doctor.<br>
<br>
In this sentence, “who lives next door” is a relative clause that modifies the noun “man.”<br>
<br>
Relative clauses can also be used to give additional information about a noun or pronoun. For example:<br>
<br>
The book, which was written by a famous author, is very popular.<br>
<br>
In this sentence, “which was written by a famous author” is a relative clause that gives additional information about the noun “book.”<br>
<br>
Relative clauses can also be used to combine two sentences into one. For example:<br>
<br>
The man is a doctor. He lives next door.<br>
<br>
This can be combined into one sentence using a relative clause:<br>
<br>
The man who lives next door is a doctor.<br>
<br>
It is important to remember that relative clauses must always be connected to a noun or pronoun. For example:<br>
<br>
He lives next door, who is a doctor.<br>
<br>
This sentence is incorrect because the relative clause “who is a doctor” is not connected to a noun or pronoun.<br>
<br>
Now that you understand the basics of relative clauses, let’s practice using them in sentences. Try to create your own sentences using relative clauses. For example:<br>
<br>
The woman whose car broke down needs a ride.<br>
<br>
Remember to always connect the relative clause to a noun or pronoun. Good luck!</p>
<h2>Active and Passive Voice</h2>
<p><br>
Active and Passive Voice<br>
<br>
In English, the active voice and the passive voice are two different ways of expressing the same idea. The active voice is used when the subject of the sentence is performing the action. The passive voice is used when the subject of the sentence is receiving the action.<br>
<br>
Active Voice:<br>
<br>
In the active voice, the subject of the sentence is performing the action. For example:<br>
<br>
The teacher teaches the students.<br>
<br>
In this sentence, the subject (the teacher) is performing the action (teaching).<br>
<br>
Passive Voice:<br>
<br>
In the passive voice, the subject of the sentence is receiving the action. For example:<br>
<br>
The students are taught by the teacher.<br>
<br>
In this sentence, the subject (the students) is receiving the action (being taught).<br>
<br>
Rules for Using Active and Passive Voice:<br>
<br>
1. The active voice is used when the subject of the sentence is performing the action.<br>
<br>
2. The passive voice is used when the subject of the sentence is receiving the action.<br>
<br>
3. The verb in the active voice sentence is in the present tense, while the verb in the passive voice sentence is in the past participle form.<br>
<br>
4. The object of the active voice sentence becomes the subject of the passive voice sentence.<br>
<br>
5. The subject of the active voice sentence becomes the object of the passive voice sentence.<br>
<br>
Examples:<br>
<br>
Active Voice:<br>
<br>
The teacher teaches the students.<br>
<br>
Passive Voice:<br>
<br>
The students are taught by the teacher.</p>
<h2>Conditionals</h2>
<p><br>
Conditionals<br>
<br>
Conditionals are a type of sentence structure used to express a condition and its result. They are used to talk about possible situations and their consequences.<br>
<br>
1. Zero Conditional<br>
<br>
The zero conditional is used to talk about general truths or facts. It is formed with two present simple clauses.<br>
<br>
Example:<br>
If you heat ice, it melts.<br>
<br>
2. First Conditional<br>
<br>
The first conditional is used to talk about possible future events and their results. It is formed with a present simple clause and a future clause.<br>
<br>
Example:<br>
If it rains tomorrow, I will stay at home.<br>
<br>
3. Second Conditional<br>
<br>
The second conditional is used to talk about hypothetical situations and their results. It is formed with a past simple clause and a conditional clause.<br>
<br>
Example:<br>
If I won the lottery, I would buy a house.<br>
<br>
4. Third Conditional<br>
<br>
The third conditional is used to talk about hypothetical past events and their results. It is formed with a past perfect clause and a conditional perfect clause.<br>
<br>
Example:<br>
If I had won the lottery, I would have bought a house.</p>
<h2>Reported Speech.</h2>
<p><br>
Reported Speech<br>
<br>
Reported speech is a way of expressing what someone else has said. It is also known as indirect speech. In reported speech, the tense of the original sentence changes.<br>
<br>
When using reported speech, the following changes should be made:<br>
<br>
1. Pronouns: The pronouns used in the reported speech should be changed to reflect the speaker. For example, if the original speaker said “I am going to the store”, the reported speech would be “He/She was going to the store”.<br>
<br>
2. Tense: The tense of the reported speech should be changed to reflect the time of the original statement. For example, if the original speaker said “I am going to the store”, the reported speech would be “He/She was going to the store”.<br>
<br>
3. Time and Place: The time and place of the original statement should be changed to reflect the time and place of the reported speech. For example, if the original speaker said “I am going to the store tomorrow”, the reported speech would be “He/She was going to the store the next day”.<br>
<br>
4. Modal Verbs: Modal verbs should be changed to reflect the speaker’s attitude. For example, if the original speaker said “I can go to the store”, the reported speech would be “He/She could go to the store”.<br>
<br>
5. Other Verbs: Other verbs should be changed to reflect the speaker’s attitude. For example, if the original speaker said “I want to go to the store”, the reported speech would be “He/She wanted to go to the store”.<br>
<br>
Practice<br>
<br>
Now that you understand the basics of reported speech, let’s practice.<br>
<br>
1. She said, “I am going to the store.”<br>
<br>
Answer: She said that she was going to the store.<br>
<br>
2. He said, “I can go to the store.”<br>
<br>
Answer: He said that he could go to the store.<br>
<br>
3. She said, “I want to go to the store.”<br>
<br>
Answer: She said that she wanted to go to the store.</p>

<h2>Antonyms</h2>
<p><br>
Antonyms<br>
<br>
Antonyms are words that have opposite meanings. They are an important part of the English language and are often tested on the TOEFL exam.<br>
<br>
In this lesson, we will look at some common antonyms and how to use them in sentences.<br>
<br>
Antonyms can be divided into two categories:<br>
<br>
1. Exact Antonyms: These are words that have opposite meanings and cannot be used interchangeably. Examples include: hot/cold, up/down, and in/out.<br>
<br>
2. Gradable Antonyms: These are words that have opposite meanings but can be used interchangeably depending on the context. Examples include: big/small, fast/slow, and happy/sad.<br>
<br>
It is important to note that some words can have multiple antonyms. For example, the word “good” can have the antonyms “bad”, “poor”, and “evil”.<br>
<br>
Now let’s look at some examples of how to use antonyms in sentences:<br>
<br>
1. The temperature outside is hot, but inside it is cold.<br>
<br>
2. The plane flew up into the sky and then descended back down.<br>
<br>

<br>
In this lesson, you will learn how to recognize and use common collocations.<br>
<br>
1. Recognizing Collocations<br>
<br>
Collocations are combinations of words that are often used together. For example, “make an effort” or “take a break”. To recognize collocations, you need to pay attention to the words that are used together.<br>
<br>
For example, if you see the words “make” and “effort” together, you can assume that they are used in a collocation.<br>
<br>

Once you have recognized a collocation, you can use it in your own speaking and writing. Here are some tips for using collocations:<br>
<br>
• Use collocations in the correct form. For example, “make an effort”, not “make effort”.<br>
• Use collocations in the correct context. For example, “take a break”, not “take a look”.<br>
• Use collocations to sound more natural. For example, “come up with”, not “think of”.<br>
<br>
4. Practice<br>
<br>
Now it’s time to practice using collocations. Try to use the collocations from this lesson in your own speaking and writing. Here are some ideas for practice:<br>
<br>
• Write a short story using as many collocations as you can.<br>
• Have a conversation with a friend using collocations.<br>
• Write a blog post using collocations.<br>
<br>
By practicing using collocations, you will be able to use them more naturally in the TOEFL test. Good luck!</p>
<h2>Word Families</h2>
<p><br>
Word Families<br>
<br>
Word families are groups of words that share a common root or stem. They are a great way to expand your English vocabulary quickly.<br>
<br>
In this lesson, we will look at some of the most common word families and how to use them.<br>
<br>
1. Nouns: Nouns are words that refer to people, places, things, or ideas. Common nouns include words like “book”, “table”, and “city”. Nouns can be made into other forms by adding suffixes. For example, the noun “book” can be changed to “books” (plural), “booked” (past tense), and “booking” (present participle).<br>
<br>
2. Verbs: Verbs are words that describe an action or state of being. Common verbs include words like “run”, “jump”, and “be”. Verbs can be made into other forms by adding suffixes. For example, the verb “run” can be changed to “ran” (past tense), “running” (present participle), and “runner” (noun).<br>
<br>
3. Adjectives: Adjectives are words that describe or modify nouns. Common adjectives include words like “big”, “small”, and “happy”. Adjectives can be made into other forms by adding suffixes. For example, the adjective “big” can be changed to “bigger” (comparative), “biggest” (superlative), and “bigly” (adverb).<br>
<br>
4. Adverbs: Adverbs are words that modify or describe verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs. Common adverbs include words like “quickly”, “slowly”, and “carefully”. Adverbs can be made into other forms by adding suffixes. For example, the adverb “quickly” can be changed to “quick” (adjective), “quicker” (comparative), and “quickest” (superlative).<br>
<br>
By understanding and recognizing word families, you can quickly expand your English vocabulary</p>
<h2>Prefixes</h2>
<p><br>
Prefixes<br>
<br>
Prefixes are a type of affix that is added to the beginning of a word to change its meaning. They are a great way to expand your English vocabulary. Here are some of the most common prefixes and their meanings:<br>
<br>

<h2>Suffixes</h2>
<p><br>
Suffixes<br>
<br>
Suffixes are a type of word ending that can change the meaning of a word. They are added to the end of a word to create a new word. For example, adding the suffix “-ly” to the word “quick” creates the word “quickly”.<br>
<br>
In English, there are many different suffixes that can be used to create new words. Here are some of the most common suffixes and their meanings:<br>
<br>
-able: able to be done<br>
-ment: the action or result of<br>
-ness: a state or quality<br>
-ly: in a certain way<br>
-ful: full of<br>
-less: without<br>
-tion: the action or process of<br>
-sion: the action or process of<br>
-ity: the state or quality of<br>
<br>
For example, the word “comfort” can be changed to “comfortable” by adding the suffix “-able”. This changes the meaning of the word from “a feeling of ease” to “able to be comfortable”.<br>
<br>
When studying for the TOEFL test, it is important to be familiar with suffixes and how they can change the meaning of words. This will help you understand the meaning of words in the reading and listening sections of the test.</p>
<h2>Compound Words.</h2>
<p><br>
Compound Words<br>
<br>
Compound words are words that are made up of two or more words. They are very common in English and can be used to express complex ideas in a single word.<br>
<br>
There are three main types of compound words:<br>
<br>
1. Closed Compounds: These are words that are written as one word, such as ‘sunflower’ or ‘toothbrush’.<br>
<br>
2. Hyphenated Compounds: These are words that are written with a hyphen between them, such as ‘mother-in-law’ or ‘check-in’.<br>
<br>
3. Open Compounds: These are words that are written as two separate words, such as ‘ice cream’ or ‘full moon’.<br>
<br>
It is important to remember that the meaning of a compound word is not always the same as the meaning of the two words that make it up. For example, the word ‘blackboard’ does not mean a board that is black, but rather a board that is used for writing on with chalk.<br>
<br>
Practice<br>
<br>
Now try to match the following compound words with their definitions:<br>
<br>
1. Sunflower 																																												A. A person who is not married<br>
<br>
2. Toothbrush 																																										B. A type of flower that follows the sun<br>
<br>
3. Mother-in-law 																																							C. A brush used for cleaning teeth<br>
<br>
4. Check-in 																																										D. The process of registering at a hotel or airport<br>
<br>
5. Ice cream 											</p>
<h1>Reading Comprehension</h1>
<h2>Skimming and Scanning</h2>
<p><br>
Skimming and Scanning<br>
<br>
Skimming and scanning are two important reading strategies that can help you quickly find the information you need in a text. Skimming is the process of quickly reading a text to get the main idea, while scanning is the process of looking for specific information in a text.<br>
<br>
Skimming:<br>
<br>
Skimming is a useful technique for quickly getting the main idea of a text. When skimming, you should read the title, introduction, and conclusion of the text, as well as any headings and subheadings. You should also look for key words and phrases that stand out. As you read, try to identify the main idea of the text and any important details.<br>
<br>
Scanning:<br>
<br>
Scanning is a useful technique for quickly finding specific information in a text. When scanning, you should look for key words and phrases that are related to the information you are looking for. You should also look for any headings and subheadings that may contain the information you need. As you read, try to identify the specific information you are looking for and any related details.<br>
<br>
Practice:<br>
<br>
Now that you know the basics of skimming and scanning, it’s time to practice. Read the following passage and try to identify the main idea and any important details. Then, use scanning to find the answer to the following question: What is the author’s opinion on the use of technology in the classroom?<br>
<br>
The use of technology in the classroom has become increasingly popular in recent years. Many teachers now use computers, tablets, and other devices to help their students learn. While technology can be a great tool for teaching, it is important to remember that it should not be used as a replacement for traditional teaching methods. Technology should be used to supplement and enhance the learning experience, not to replace it.<br>
<br>
Answer: The author's opinion on the use of technology in the classroom is that it should be used to supplement and enhance the learning experience, not to replace it.</p>
<h2>Identifying Main Ideas</h2>
<p><br>
Identifying Main Ideas<br>
<br>
In this lesson, you will learn how to identify the main idea of a passage. The main idea is the most important point the author is trying to make. It is the central focus of the passage.<br>
<br>
To identify the main idea, you should first read the passage carefully. As you read, ask yourself questions such as:<br>
<br>
- What is the author trying to tell me?<br>
- What is the main point of the passage?<br>
- What is the author's purpose in writing this passage?<br>
<br>
Once you have read the passage, you should be able to identify the main idea. It is usually stated in the first or last sentence of the passage.<br>
<br>
You can also identify the main idea by looking for key words or phrases. These words or phrases will often be repeated throughout the passage. They will help you to understand the author's purpose and the main point of the passage.<br>
<br>
Finally, you should be able to summarize the main idea in one or two sentences. This will help you to remember the main point of the passage and will be useful when answering questions on the TOEFL test.<br>
<br>
Now that you know how to identify the main idea of a passage, you can practice with the following exercises.</p>

<h2>Making Inferences</h2>
<p><br>
Making Inferences<br>
<br>
In this lesson, we will learn how to make inferences when reading. An inference is a conclusion that you draw based on the information that you have. It is important to be able to make inferences when taking the TOEFL test, as it is a skill that is tested in the reading comprehension section.<br>
<br>
To make an inference, you must first read the text carefully and identify the main idea. Then, you must look for clues in the text that can help you draw a conclusion. These clues can be in the form of words, phrases, or sentences.<br>
<br>
Let’s look at an example.<br>
<br>
The text reads:<br>
<br>
“The woman was wearing a bright yellow dress. She was smiling and seemed very happy.”<br>
<br>
From this text, we can infer that the woman was in a good mood.<br>
<br>
Now, let’s look at another example.<br>
<br>
The text reads:<br>
<br>
“The man was walking quickly and looking around nervously. He was carrying a large bag.”<br>
<br>
From this text, we can infer that the man was in a hurry and was trying to avoid being seen.<br>
<br>
As you can see, making inferences is a skill that requires careful reading and analysis of the text. It is important to look for clues in the text that can help you draw a conclusion.<br>
<br>
Now that you understand the concept of making inferences, let’s practice. Read the following text and make an inference.<br>
<br>
The text reads:<br>
<br>
“The woman was sitting alone in the park. She was wearing a long black coat and had a sad expression on her face.”<br>
<br>
From this text, we can infer that the woman was feeling sad.</p>

<p><br>
Identifying Factual Information<br>
<br>
In the TOEFL test, you will be asked to identify factual information from a given text. This means that you will need to be able to recognize and understand the facts that are presented in the text.<br>
<br>
To help you identify factual information, it is important to understand the structure of the text. Look for key words and phrases that are used to introduce facts. These words and phrases can include:<br>
<br>
• “It is true that…”<br>
• “It is a fact that…”<br>
• “It is clear that…”<br>
• “It is evident that…”<br>
• “It is obvious that…”<br>
<br>
When you come across these words and phrases, you can be sure that the sentence that follows will contain factual information.<br>
<br>
It is also important to pay attention to the details in the text. Look for specific numbers, dates, and names that are mentioned. These are all clues that the information is factual.<br>
<br>
Finally, look for words and phrases that indicate a cause and effect relationship. These words and phrases can include:<br>
<br>
• “As a result…”<br>
• “Therefore…”<br>
• “Consequently…”<br>
• “Because of this…”<br>
<br>
When you come across these words and phrases, you can be sure that the sentence that follows will contain factual information.<br>
<br>
By understanding the structure of the text and paying attention to the details, you will be able to identify factual information in the TOEFL test.</p>
<h2>Identifying Implied Information.</h2>
<p><br>
Identifying Implied Information<br>
<br>
In the TOEFL test, you will often be asked to identify information that is implied in a passage. This means that you will need to read between the lines and draw conclusions from the text.<br>
<br>
To do this, you will need to pay attention to the context of the passage and the words that are used. Look for clues that the author has given you, such as words that suggest a certain emotion or opinion.<br>
<br>
You should also look for words that suggest a cause and effect relationship. For example, if the author says that something “led to” something else, then you can infer that the first thing caused the second thing.<br>
<br>
You should also look for words that suggest a comparison or contrast. For example, if the author says that something is “similar to” something else, then you can infer that the two things have some similarities.<br>
<br>
Finally, you should look for words that suggest a conclusion. For example, if the author says that something “proves” something else, then you can infer that the first thing is evidence for the second thing.<br>
<br>
By paying attention to the context and the words that are used, you can identify implied information in a passage. This skill is important for the TOEFL test, so make sure to practice it.</p>

<h2>Making inferences</h2>
<p><br>
Making inferences<br>
<br>
In this lesson, we will learn how to make inferences while listening to a passage. Making inferences is an important skill for the TOEFL test, as it requires you to understand the meaning of a passage beyond the literal words.<br>
<br>
To make an inference, you need to use the information given in the passage and combine it with your own knowledge and experience. This will help you to draw conclusions and make assumptions about the passage.<br>
<br>
Let’s look at an example.<br>
<br>
Example:<br>
<br>
You hear a passage about a woman who is talking about her job.<br>
<br>
The woman says: “I love my job. I get to travel all over the world and meet new people.”<br>
<br>
From this statement, you can infer that the woman’s job involves a lot of travel.<br>
<br>
Now let’s look at another example.<br>
<br>
Example:<br>
<br>
You hear a passage about a man who is talking about his hobby.<br>
<br>
The man says: “I love to paint. I spend hours in my studio every day.”<br>
<br>

<br>
To do this, you must pay attention to the words the speaker uses and the tone of their voice. Here are some tips to help you identify the speaker's attitude:<br>
<br>
1. Listen for words that express opinion or emotion. Words like "love," "hate," "believe," "think," and "feel" can give you clues about the speaker's attitude.<br>
<br>
2. Listen for words that express certainty or uncertainty. Words like "always," "never," "certainly," and "maybe" can give you clues about how sure the speaker is about their opinion.<br>
<br>
3. Listen for words that express agreement or disagreement. Words like "agree," "disagree," "support," and "oppose" can give you clues about the speaker's opinion.<br>
<br>
4. Listen for words that express approval or disapproval. Words like "good," "bad," "right," and "wrong" can give you clues about the speaker's opinion.<br>
<br>

<h2>Understanding idioms and expressions</h2>
<p><br>
Understanding Idioms and Expressions<br>
<br>
Idioms and expressions are an important part of the English language. They are used to express ideas and feelings in a more creative and interesting way. Understanding idioms and expressions is essential for success on the TOEFL test.<br>
<br>
In this lesson, you will learn how to recognize and understand idioms and expressions. We will look at some common idioms and expressions and practice using them in context.<br>
<br>
First, let’s look at what an idiom is. An idiom is a phrase or expression that has a figurative meaning that is different from its literal meaning. For example, the phrase “it’s raining cats and dogs” does not mean that cats and dogs are literally falling from the sky. Instead, it means that it is raining heavily.<br>
<br>
Expressions are similar to idioms, but they are usually shorter and less figurative. For example, the expression “piece of cake” does not mean that you are eating a cake. Instead, it means that something is very easy.<br>
<br>
Now that you know what idioms and expressions are, let’s look at some common examples. Here are some common idioms and expressions:<br>
<br>
• “It’s a piece of cake” – This means that something is very easy.<br>
• “It’s raining cats and dogs” – This means that it is raining heavily.<br>
• “Let the cat out of the bag” – This means to reveal a secret.<br>
• “Break a leg” – This means to wish someone good luck.<br>
• “Hit the nail on the head” – This means to get something exactly right.<br>
<br>
Now that you know some common idioms and expressions, let’s practice using them in context. Here are some example sentences:<br>
<br>
• “I’m sure the test will be a piece of cake.”<br>
• “It’s been raining cats and dogs all day.”<br>
• “Don’t let the cat out of the bag – it’s a surprise!”<br>
• “Break a leg before your performance!”<br>
• “You hit the nail on the head with that answer!”<br>
<br>
Now that you know how to recognize and understand idioms and expressions</p>

<h2>Understanding complex sentences.</h2>
<p><br>
Understanding complex sentences<br>
<br>
In this lesson, we will focus on understanding complex sentences. Complex sentences are sentences that contain one independent clause and one or more dependent clauses.<br>
<br>
An independent clause is a group of words that contains a subject and a verb and expresses a complete thought.<br>
<br>
A dependent clause is a group of words that contains a subject and a verb but does not express a complete thought.<br>
<br>
In order to understand complex sentences, it is important to understand the relationship between the independent and dependent clauses. The dependent clause usually modifies the independent clause.<br>
<br>
For example, in the sentence "I went to the store after I finished my homework," the independent clause is "I went to the store" and the dependent clause is "after I finished my homework." The dependent clause modifies the independent clause by telling us when the action of the independent clause took place.<br>
<br>
It is also important to understand the different types of dependent clauses. There are three types of dependent clauses: adverb clauses, adjective clauses, and noun clauses.<br>
<br>
Adverb clauses modify verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. They usually begin with a subordinating conjunction such as "when," "while," or "because."<br>
<br>
Adjective clauses modify nouns and pronouns. They usually begin with a relative pronoun such as "who," "which," or "that."<br>
<br>
Noun clauses act as the subject or object of a verb. They usually begin with a subordinating conjunction such as "that," "if," or "whether."<br>
<br>
Now that you understand the basics of complex sentences, let's practice. Read the following sentences and identify the independent and dependent clauses.<br>
<br>
1. I went to the store after I finished my homework.<br>
Independent clause: I went to the store<br>
Dependent clause: after I finished my homework<br>
<br>
2. I will go to the store if I have time.<br>
Independent clause: I will go to the store<br>
Dependent clause: if I have time</p>

<h2>Punctuation</h2>
<p><br>
Punctuation<br>
<br>
Punctuation is an important part of writing in English. It helps to make your writing clear and easy to understand. In this lesson, we will look at the different types of punctuation and how to use them correctly.<br>
<br>
1. Full Stop (.)<br>
<br>
A full stop is used to mark the end of a sentence. It is also used after abbreviations.<br>
<br>
Examples:<br>
<br>
I like to read books.<br>
<br>
My name is John Smith Jr.<br>
<br>
2. Comma (,)<br>
<br>
A comma is used to separate items in a list, to separate two independent clauses, and to indicate a pause in a sentence.<br>
<br>
Examples:<br>
<br>
I like to read books, watch movies, and go for walks.<br>
<br>
I went to the store, but I didn't buy anything.<br>
<br>
3. Colon (:)<br>
<br>
A colon is used to introduce a list or to introduce a quotation.<br>
<br>
Examples:<br>
<br>
I need to buy the following items: milk, eggs, bread, and cheese.<br>
<br>
He said: "I'm going to the store."<br>
<br>
4. Semicolon (;)<br>
<br>
A semicolon is used to separate two independent clauses that are closely related.<br>
<br>
Examples:<br>
<br>
I like to read books; I also like to watch movies.<br>
<br>
I went to the store; however, I didn't buy anything.<br>
<br>

He said, "I'm going to the store."<br>
<br>
She asked, "What time is it?"<br>
<br>

<h2>Essay Structure</h2>
<p><br>
Essay Structure<br>
<br>
Writing an essay for the TOEFL test can be a daunting task. However, with the right structure and approach, you can make the process easier and more successful. In this lesson, we will discuss the structure of an essay and how to organize your ideas.<br>
<br>
1. Introduction: The introduction of your essay should provide an overview of the main points you will discuss. It should also include a thesis statement that clearly states your opinion or argument.<br>
<br>
2. Body: The body of your essay should include several paragraphs that support your thesis statement. Each paragraph should focus on one main point and provide evidence to support it.<br>
<br>
3. Conclusion: The conclusion of your essay should summarize the main points you discussed in the body of your essay. It should also provide a final thought or opinion on the topic.<br>
<br>
By following this structure, you can ensure that your essay is organized and easy to read. Additionally, it will help you stay focused on the main points of your essay and make sure that your argument is clear and concise.</p>

<h2>Sentence Structure</h2>
<p><br>
Sentence Structure<br>
<br>
In English, there are four main types of sentences: declarative, interrogative, imperative, and exclamatory. <br>
<br>
Declarative Sentences: Declarative sentences make a statement and end with a period. For example, "I am going to the store."<br>
<br>
Interrogative Sentences: Interrogative sentences ask a question and end with a question mark. For example, "Where are you going?"<br>
<br>
Imperative Sentences: Imperative sentences give a command or make a request and end with a period. For example, "Please close the door."<br>
<br>
Exclamatory Sentences: Exclamatory sentences express strong emotion and end with an exclamation mark. For example, "I can't believe it!"<br>
<br>
In addition to these four types of sentences, there are also compound and complex sentences. <br>
<br>
Compound Sentences: Compound sentences are made up of two or more independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction (for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so). For example, "I am going to the store, but I don't know what I need."<br>
<br>
Complex Sentences: Complex sentences are made up of one independent clause and one or more dependent clauses. Dependent clauses cannot stand alone as a sentence. For example, "I am going to the store because I need to buy food."<br>
<br>
It is important to understand the different types of sentences and how to use them correctly when writing for the TOEFL test.</p>

<h2>Cohesion and Coherence</h2>
<p><br>
Cohesion and Coherence<br>
<br>
Cohesion and coherence are two important aspects of writing that help make your writing clear and easy to understand. Cohesion is the use of words, phrases, and sentences to connect ideas and make them flow together. Coherence is the logical organization of ideas and the use of transitions to make the writing understandable.<br>
<br>
Cohesion<br>
<br>
Cohesion is achieved through the use of words, phrases, and sentences that link ideas together. This includes the use of pronouns, synonyms, and repetition.<br>
<br>
Pronouns: Pronouns are words that refer to a noun or noun phrase. They can be used to refer back to a noun that has already been mentioned in the text. For example, "John went to the store. He bought some apples."<br>
<br>
Synonyms: Synonyms are words that have the same or similar meanings. They can be used to avoid repetition and make the writing more interesting. For example, "John went to the store. He purchased some apples."<br>
<br>
Repetition: Repetition is the use of the same word or phrase multiple times. It can be used to emphasize an idea or to create a rhythm in the writing. For example, "John went to the store. He went to the store again and again."<br>
<br>
Coherence<br>
<br>
Coherence is achieved through the use of logical organization and transitions. Logical organization is the arrangement of ideas in a way that makes sense and is easy to follow. Transitions are words or phrases that help connect ideas and make the writing flow.<br>
<br>
Logical Organization: Logical organization is important for making sure that the ideas in your writing are easy to understand. It involves arranging the ideas in a logical order and using headings and subheadings to help the reader follow the flow of the writing.<br>
<br>
Transitions: Transitions are words or phrases that help connect ideas and make the writing flow. Examples of transitions include words like "however," "therefore," and "in addition." They can be used to show relationships between ideas and to make the writing more cohesive.<br>
<br>
By using cohesion and coherence in your writing, you can make your writing clear and easy to understand. This will help you score higher on the TOEFL test.</p>
